# 2nd_ReactJS
My second ReactJS repo. It's all about Multiselect Dropdown using useState Hook.

View it here - https://Yuvraj-Kaushal.github.io/2nd_ReactJS/

I've used Multiselect Library in this. You can also use this library by executing the command below in your terminal :- 

Command - npm install multiselect-react-dropdown

To import this library type - import { Multiselect } from 'multiselect-react-dropdown';
